# AIIR
Artificial Intelligence Image Recognition (AIIR) is a Python project that aims to develop CNN model that can be used for image recognition. It was divided into two parts. 

The first one aiming to expand it's participants knowledge about applications and usage of Artificial Intelligence in modern programming challanges, and to train them in using such solutions in actual real life problems. In this part two different datasets are used, to develop optimal data preparation techniques, find best network models and evaluate their results.

The second part is to use gained knowledge and developed tools in cooperation with another project: Project Webcam, which uses digital camera to capture in real time hand gestures. Project AIIR will then be used in a basic classification problem, to determine what gestures were shown.


### Important notes before using the script
Currently working file is named "poniedzialek.py". The "main.py" file is still being worked on, as the final goal of this project has not been achieved yet.

The script requires you to have a dataset unpacked in a directory with the following path: "datasets/gestures_dataset".
It is possible to change that, which can be done if the first line of the main function.
